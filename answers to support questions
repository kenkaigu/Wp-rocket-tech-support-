QUESTION 1 : How the team mate should respond to  question :


Hello sir,
Thanks for reaching ouT. We apologise for any inconvinience you have experienced .

Because you have disabled WP Rocket’s automatic cache clearing system, the next option is to use a chron job which can automate this,
and clear at a specific timeframe and i am going to guide you on this.

To begin, 

Step 1.  

Login to your hosting server and Set up a chron job .
If you are using cpanel , we have a video to guide you : https://recordit.co/A4Jj1Kg7x9  
you can also click here to understand more about chron jobs and how to set them up.
https://docs.wp-rocket.me/article/1279-cron-and-wp-rocket#setting-up-cron-job . Please feel free to discuss more about chron jobs with your host provider

Step 2. 

Once done with step 1, we need to create a php file to help with cache clearing . 

a. you can create a php file with notepad or any editor you have and give it a name ...for example in this example, mine is called clear_cache.php
b. Since you want to clear the HTML files and Combined/minified CSS/JavaScript files, add this code 
 
<?php
// Load WordPress.
require( 'wp-load.php' );

// code to Clear HTML cache files.
if ( function_exists( 'rocket_clean_domain' ) ) {
	rocket_clean_domain();
}
//code to clear the combined/minified CSS/JavaScript files,  
 
if ( function_exists( 'rocket_clean_minify' ) ) {
	rocket_clean_minify();
}


Save this file , and upload it to your root folder. ( its where wp-config.php is located)

Step 3:
Once step 2 is done,  set up the time you would want to run the cache, when there is little activity going on on your site .

Common settings you will find are :

Minute – The minute setting for the cron job.
Hour – The hour setting for the cron job.
Day – The day setting for the cron job.
Month – The month setting for the cron job.
Weekday – The weekday setting for the cron job.

Next, on the command field, you need to place the exact url to the file we created on step 2.

wget -q -O - http://yourdomain.com/clear_cache.php >/dev/null 2>&1

add the above code, and replace the url part with your actual domain name, and file name 

Save your changes once done .

Kindly let us know if this solution works for you . 
Looking forward to further engagements

 Issue 2 
 
 How the tech support should troubleshoot the issue

 For a better understanding, Have a look the common issues related to Cron https://docs.wp-rocket.me/article/1279-cron-and-wp-rocket#cron-related-issues
 
 
 Since we have access to cpanel, the support should check for the following.
 
 1.check on the root of project if a chron job php file was added, and open it to confirm if the code was well written as guided earlier.
 2.confirm if the WP- chron is disabled , and that the command url for the chron job is well placed , and changes were saved.
 3.check for the php error log and find out if there is any conflicting errors showing 
 
 If the code , and setting up is well done,Request the client to contact the hosting provider for a more closer look on the chron job and settings and get back to us
